# 2-Player-Chess
Two Player chess game  using a Spring Boot web application

## Project Structure
The project consists of 3 different Modules:
1. webapp: This module contains the Spring web application
2. backend: This module contains the entire game logic for two player chess

For the deployment there is a Dockerfile in the project directory.
This was used to create a Docker image and push it to DockerHub.
A web service was then created with Render (https://render.com/), which works with the DockerHub image.
